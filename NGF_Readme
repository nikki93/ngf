|   NGF - nikki's Game Framework   |
+----------------------------------+

NGF is a set of framework classes that helps write software, especially
games using Ogre. It requires boost.

To get NGF working with your project, just include the file 'Ngf.h'
(located in the 'include' folder), and compile and link 'Ngf.cpp' and
'ConfigFile.cpp' with your project.

To build the 'ngftutorials', you'll have to edit the respective
'premake.lua' file to reflect the include and library
directories on your computer, and use the 'premake' tool (from
http://premake.sourceforge.net/) to build the respective project
files. Check the 'premake.lua' files, they're commented.

To use the Blender Exporter, put the file 'ngf_export.py' (located in
the 'blenderExport' folder) in your Blender scripts folder (by default,
<blender installation folder>/.blender/scripts). To create brushes
(objects of the same type, but with different meshes) in Blender, give
a property 'isBrush' to the object in Blender, and get the mesh name in
your code from the 'brushMeshFile' property. You can learn more about
using Blender with NGF in the tutorial under the 'docs' folder.

For further documentation and explanation, refer to the manual and
tutorial under the 'docs' folder.
